                            <br> And consider myself a lil minecraft gray hat hacker (I focus on security without compromising others' experiences).
                            <br> Well... That was me in the past
                            <br> Currently, I’m focused on styding about what i am interested in, about
                            <br> Mechatronics Engineering, which includes learning about mechanical, electrical, electronic, and software engineering.
                            <br> And developing & selling minecraft plugins and a litlle bit of Games-development in unity in my free time.
